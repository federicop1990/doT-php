PHP rendering engine for [doT.js (The fastest + concise javascript template engine for nodejs and browsers)](https://github.com/olado/doT).

How to use it
-------------

Todo

Warning
-------

It's far from complete. I needed it just to provide a server side rendering engine for another project ([COPS](https://github.com/seblucas/cops)).

So the code provided works perfectly for the templates of COPS and was never tested elsewhere, doT's unit test were also never tested.

That being said, You can fork, enhance it and send me some pull request, I'll happily merge them.
